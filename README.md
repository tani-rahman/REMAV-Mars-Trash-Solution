## Overview

**ReMAV (Recycle Mars Waste)** addresses one of the most critical challenges for future Mars missions — the sustainable management and reuse of inorganic waste.  

Astronauts generate large amounts of trash during long-duration space missions, including packaging, fabrics, EVA materials, and structural components, which cannot be sent back to Earth. ReMAV proposes practical recycling methods to convert these materials into reusable resources that promote sustainability, efficiency, and survival on Mars.

## Features

- **Informative Landing Page:** Introduces the importance of recycling systems for Martian missions  
- **Interactive Trash-to-Solution System:** Displays categorized waste materials with detailed recycling and repurposing processes  
- **User Login & Feedback:** Allows registered users to comment and share feedback on recycling solutions  
- **Expandable Architecture:** Future versions will allow users to contribute their own recycling ideas  

---

## How It Works

Visitors can explore various waste categories such as packaging, textiles, EVA waste, and structural materials. Each category leads to a detailed page describing how that waste can be recycled or reused, supported by explanations, visuals, and end-product examples. Logged-in users can engage by commenting and giving feedback, helping shape better recycling ideas.
